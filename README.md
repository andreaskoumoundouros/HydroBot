# HydroBot
A general use bot designed for the discord server owned by me.
Still very WIP but is intended to have functionality to manage game servers from bot commands etc.

Also planned to have general bot functionality such as "fun" commands like the 'cat' command already implemented and more standard
functionality such as music playback.

## TODO (In no particular order)
~~- Manage server settings, start, stop, etc from commands (Maybe?)
    - Have some form of user moderation/privilege so that only specified users can modify server~~ NOT NEEDED
- Show server status(es) on bot now playing.
- Per user settings and preferences.
- Add music playback functionality.
~~- DELETE THE USER'S HELP MESSAGE AFTER THEY GET THE DM~~ DONE
